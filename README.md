Cliff's BBQ Stand represents my pinnacle project for 2024 coded in Python.  
It is an ordering system for a small restaurant that includes the menu, 
order placement, payment, survey, subscriber signup, and admin functionality
that includes historical reporting. The entire work is my own design from 
conception to implementation. The console version is complete as of 10/06/2024, 
but I am still working on a front end web deployed version. This project is the 
culmination of many concepts I have learned since July 2023.
